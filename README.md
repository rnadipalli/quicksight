## About the Book
Amazon QuickSight is a very fast, cloud-powered business intelligence (BI) service that makes it easy for all employees to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from their data. Amazon QuickSight uses a new Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine (“SPICE”) to perform advanced calculations and render visualizations rapidly.

This book begins with introducing you to Amazon Quicksight and will help you understand the foundation for the upcoming chapters. Moving ahead; you will get to know the entire eco-system right from getting the date into the tools and using Quicksight’s features to gain insights.
